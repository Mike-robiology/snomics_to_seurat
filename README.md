# MAP Multiome Seurat Workflow

A series of linked scripts for processing multiome nf-core-snomics output into a merged and integrated seurat object for analysis. Designed to handle the resource requirements of snRNAseq + snATACseq in a HPC environment.

TODO:
- model resource requirements (reason: avoids resource issues (e.g. merge odd resource requirements))
- Add publish of macs2 consensus peaks
